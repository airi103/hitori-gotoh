# hitori-gotoh
It's a Kessoku Band fanpage.
Just see for yourself as I am too lazy to write a decent readme right now.

[Webpage](https://airi103.github.io/hitori-gotoh/)

Everything mainly uses Tailwind CSS utility classes but some things still use custom CSS like for the animations and blur.

The webpage was made with the best mobile experience in mind so the desktop layout isn't ideal.
